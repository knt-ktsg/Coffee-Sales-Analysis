## :books: Project Description
Coffee shops typically offer a wide variety of products, and their sales fluctuate based on factors like product type, season, and time of day. Having worked in a coffee shop, I’m keen on conducting a sales analysis to identify the key drivers behind product popularity and store performance. I’ve analyzed coffee sales trends over the course of a year to uncover actionable insights aimed at boosting sales.
